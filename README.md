# Design a CPU with verilog on FPGA

We design a CPU with verilog. This responsitory contains the source codes and simulation results of the designed CPU.

## General Architecture

Our CPU embodies two parts: the CPU_Main part and the Machine Code ROM part, and they are affixed by a data bus of 8 bits. Besides, the CLK wire and the RESET wire employ the clock signals and the reset signals for the whole CPU. The general architecture of our CPU is shown below.
